# Awesome Movies

1 - Predestination

2 - Spirited Away 

*Watch this even if you don't like Anime. The pictures, the atmosphere and the story are absolutely enchanting.*

3 - Jurassic Park

*Classic. The dinosaurs look better than any CGI you will find today. The film is packed with action and suspense without overwhelming the watcher.*

4 - Monty Python's Life of Brian

*From 1979, but still as hilarious today as it was then. Maybe don't show this to your super Christian friends.*

5 - The Hobbit

*While the Hobbit was often criticized for not living up to the hype around LotR, it is a light-hearted story set in a beautiful, magical world. If LotR is too dark for you, but you still wanna watch some Tolkien fantasy, this is for you.*
