# Awesome Movies

1 - Predestination

2 - Spirited Away 

*Watch this even if you don't like Anime. The pictures, the atmosphere and the story are absolutely enchanting.*

3 - Jurassic Park

*Classic. The dinosaurs look better than any CGI you will find today. The film is packed with action and suspense without overwhelming the watcher.*

4 - Monty Python's Life of Brian

*From 1979, but still as hilarious today as it was then. Maybe don't show this to your super Christian friends.*

5 - The Hobbit

*While the Hobbit was often criticized for not living up to the hype around LotR, it is a light-hearted story set in a beautiful, magical world. If LotR is too dark for you, but you still wanna watch some Tolkien fantasy, this is for you.*

6 - John Wick (Chapter 1, Chapter 2, Parabellum)

*If you are an action movies fan, you have to watch this series. Keanu Reeves' action sequences bring out the vibes of true Super-Assasin life.*

7 - The Godfather (Trilogy)

*Do I even need to explain it?*

8 - Edge of Tomorrow

*Personal opinion : I won't say this is the best work from Tom Cruise, but it is a good movie if you are into Sci-Fi.*

9 - Saving Private Ryan

*Great story telling by Steven Spielberg, the Omaha beach scene seems close to reality.*

10 - The Pursuit of Happyness

*A heart touching movie that motivates you to do goood in life :heart: *
